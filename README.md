# PRODIGY_INTERNSHIP_TASKS
Cyber Security Projects (Python)

This repository contains 4 beginner-level Cyber Security programs, all implemented using Python.
Each program demonstrates a fundamental concept used in security, encryption, or system monitoring.

📌 Projects Included
1️⃣ Caesar Cipher

A classic encryption technique based on character shifting.

Supports encryption and decryption of text.

Demonstrates the basics of cryptography.

Concepts used:

ASCII manipulation

String handling

Encryption logic

2️⃣ Image Encryption & Decryption (Using Pillow)

Encrypts and decrypts images using pixel manipulation.

Uses the Pillow (PIL) library for image processing.

Works with sample images stored in the images/ folder.

Concepts used:

Image processing

Pixel-level encryption

External Python libraries

📂 Folder used:
Images → Contains input and output images for encryption/decryption

3️⃣ Password Complexity Checker

Checks whether a password is strong or weak.

Validates conditions like:

Minimum length

Uppercase & lowercase letters

Numbers

Special characters

Concepts used:

Regular expressions

String validation

Security best practices

4️⃣ Simple Key Logger

Records keyboard inputs and saves them to a file.

Used only for educational purposes to understand how key logging works.

📄 Output file:
key_log.txt → Stores the logged keystrokes
